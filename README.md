# cbutils
cbutils is a set open source of webapps that add basic functionality that is noticably missing on chromeos, especially when you can't add extentions due to admin policies.

cbutils is stored completely locally and makes no web requests, making it usable offline and on super restricted systems.

## usage
download and extract cbutils (anywhere works) and run `start.html`. that's it.
