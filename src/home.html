    <h3>about</h3>
    <p>
      cbutils is a set of open source webapps that are meant to add basic functionality that is noticably missing on chromeos, especially when you can't add extentions due to admin policies.<br>
      cbutils is stored completely locally and makes no web requests, making it usable offline and on super restricted systems.<br><br>
